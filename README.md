# Design Patterns (GoF)

- Patterns have four elements: pattern name, problem, solution, consequences

The design pattern space

| Purpose | Scope | Design Patterns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creational | Class | Factory Method |
| Creational | Object | Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, Singleton |
| Structural | Class | Adapter (class) |
| Structural | Object | Adapter (obj), Bridge, Comosite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy |
| Behavioral | Class | Interpreter, Template Method |
| Behavioral | Object | Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Visitor |

_Creational_ patterns concern the process of object creation
_Structural_ patterns deal with the composition of classes or objects
_Behavorial_ patterns characterize the way in which classes/objects interact and distribute resposibilities

_Class_ patterns deal with relationships between classes and their subclasses. These relationships are static - fixed at compile-time
_Object_ patterns deal with object relationships, which can differ at run-time, and thus is more dynmaic
