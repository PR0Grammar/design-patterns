# Design Patterns (GoF)

## Overview

Patterns have four elements: pattern name, problem, solution, consequences

## The Design Pattern Space

| Purpose | Scope | Design Patterns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creational | Class | [Factory Method](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Creational/factory_method) |
| Creational | Object | [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Creational/abstract_factory), [Builder](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Creational/builder), [Prototype](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Creational/prototype), [Singleton](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Creational/singleton) |
| Structural | Class | [Adapter (class)](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Structural/adapter) |
| Structural | Object | [Adapter (obj)](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Structural/adapter), [Bridge](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Structural/bridge), [Composite](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Structural/composite), [Decorator](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Structural/decorator), [Facade](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Structural/facade), Flyweight, Proxy |
| Behavioral | Class | Interpreter, Template Method |
| Behavioral | Object | Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Visitor |

_Creational_ patterns concern the process of object creation
_Structural_ patterns deal with the composition of classes or objects
_Behavorial_ patterns characterize the way in which classes/objects interact and distribute resposibilities

_Class_ patterns deal with relationships between classes and their subclasses. These relationships are static - fixed at compile-time
_Object_ patterns deal with object relationships, which can differ at run-time, and thus is more dynmaic
