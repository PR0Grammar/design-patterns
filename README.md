# Design Patterns (GoF style)

## Overview

Design patterns provide common structure for solutions to design problems in your code.

This repo focues on the "Gang of Four" design patterns.

## The Design Pattern Space

| Purpose | Scope | Design Patterns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creational | Class | [Factory Method](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Creational/factory_method) |
| Creational | Object | [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Creational/abstract_factory), [Builder](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Creational/builder), [Prototype](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Creational/prototype), [Singleton](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Creational/singleton) |
| Structural | Class | [Adapter (class)](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Structural/adapter) |
| Structural | Object | [Adapter (obj)](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Structural/adapter), [Bridge](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Structural/bridge), [Composite](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Structural/composite), [Decorator](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Structural/decorator), [Facade](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Structural/facade), [Flyweight](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/tree/main/Structural/flyweight), [Proxy](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/blob/main/Structural/proxy/README.md) |
| Behavioral | Class | [Interpreter](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/blob/main/Behavioral/interpreter/README.md), [Template Method](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/blob/main/Behavioral/template_method/README.md) |
| Behavioral | Object | Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, [Observer](https://github.com/PR0Grammar/design-patterns/blob/main/Behavioral/observer/README.md), State, Strategy, Visitor |

### Purpose
- _Creational_ patterns concern the process of object creation
- _Structural_ patterns deal with the composition of classes or objects
- _Behavorial_ patterns characterize the way in which classes/objects interact and distribute resposibilities

### Scope
- _Class_ patterns deal with relationships between classes and their subclasses. These relationships are static - fixed at compile-time
- _Object_ patterns deal with object relationships, which can differ at run-time, and thus is more dynmaic
